# Web Scraping Behind A Login

Two methods for accessing data behind a login.



### Using requests session object:

- For both methods of logging in the first thing needed is the name of the fields used to login and the url the login post data to. 
This can be found using the inspect tool and finding the name of the login input fields.

- Another option is to open the nextwork tab within inspect and select preserve log before logging in. Once logged in, find the login request to view the request headers and payload parameters.

- A simple requests module POST method will only work for single instances, since it doesn't save cookies. 
A requests [session](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/advanced/#session-objects) object is need to persist cookies and other parameters, keeping an account logged in for future requests. 

- Session POST requests are executed the same way as regular POST requests. Pass a dictionary containing input field names and username/password as key/vals into the data parameter. 
 
- Authentication/csrf tokens might be required. It's possible to find hidden in the login page html of some websites, but I didn't have much luck for many sites. If you do find them, you can send an initial GET request to the login page and use Beautiful soup to parse/collect the token value.

### Using Selenium WebDriver

- [Selenium WebDriver](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/getting-started.html) is a tool for automated web application testing. It provides a way to interact with multiple elements on a web page and is another option for getting past logins. 

- The webdriver is pretty straight forward. Once you know the html element ID names, you can instruct the driver insert the username/passwords into the input fields. Then you can instruct the driver to click on a submit button via an element name or its XPath. 

- I used [WebDriver Manager](https://pypi.org/project/webdriver-manager/) package to save time since it sets driver binaries without having to actually download them. 

- There is the option of running the driver headless, that is, without a GUI which can save resources and time. It is commented out in the script.
